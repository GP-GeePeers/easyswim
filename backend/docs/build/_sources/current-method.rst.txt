Current Method
=================

The existing process for managing swim meets involves several manual steps, contributing to inefficiencies and challenges for both meet organizers and participating clubs. The following outlines the current method:

1. **Meet Creation:**
   - The meet organizer initiates the meet creation process using the Meet Manager platform.
   - A .lxf file is generated, containing essential meet information such as the name, location, organizers, and structural details.

2. **File Distribution:**
   - The meet organizer sends the .lxf file to Swim Ranking, an external database storing information about swim meets.
   - Additionally, the .lxf file is sent to the participating club via email.

3. **Club Data Entry:**
   - Using the Team Manager platform, the club fills in the .lxf file with detailed information about the athletes who will be participating in the meet.
   - The club then sends the completed .lxf file back to the meet organizer via email.

4. **Individual Validation:**
   - The meet organizer employs the FPN System, a platform that individually validates each athlete's affiliation with the FPN (Portuguese Swimming Federation) and checks the validity of their medical exams up to the final date of the meet.

5. **Payment and Confirmation:**
   - The club is responsible for processing payments for each athlete who will be participating in the meet.
   - The club sends the proof of payment to the meet organizer via email for confirmation.

6. **Results Submission:**
   - At the conclusion of the meet, the organizer manually compiles and sends the meet results to Swim Rankings.

This method, characterized by manual data entry, email communication, and multiple platform interactions, results in a labor-intensive and less streamlined process. EasySwim aims to enhance this workflow by introducing a parallel platform and automating various steps for increased efficiency and convenience.
