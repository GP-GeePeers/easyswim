1. **Centralized Data Management:**
   - Our platform provides a centralized interface for meet organizers and participating clubs to manage their data and files. This centralized approach eliminates the need for manual data entry and facilitates the entire process.
2. **Platform Integration:**
   - Meet organizers initiate the process by creating a .lxf file in the Meet Manager platform.
   - The .lxf file is seamlessly transmitted to our dedicated platform.

3. **Club Interaction:**
   - Participating clubs retrieve the .lxf file from our platform, facilitating a centralized and user-friendly interface.
   - Using the Team Manager platform, clubs input detailed information about their athletes directly into the .lxf file.

4. **Automated Validation:**
   - Leveraging the FPN System, our platform automatically verifies the athletes' affiliation with the FPN and ensures the validity of their medical exams until the meet's final date.

5. **File Generation and Payment Request:**
   - Upon successful validation, our platform generates a new .lxf file containing only valid athlete entries.
   - The platform prompts the club for payment based on the number of validated athletes.

6. **Confirmation to Organizer:**
   - Once the club completes the payment, our platform notifies the meet organizer, indicating that the registrations are paid and valid.

By introducing automation, centralized data management, and real-time validation, EasySwim aims to simplify and enhance the entire swim meet management experience for both organizers and participating clubs. This innovative solution promotes efficiency, reduces manual efforts, and provides a more user-friendly approach to meet registration and validation.
