Problem Description
=======================
The process of creating, registering, validating, and enrolling athletes for swim meets, and subsequently sending this validation back to the meet organizer, is currently arduous and impractical. This poses challenges for both meet organizers and participating clubs. To address these issues, EasySwim aims to develop a platform that streamlines and simplifies this entire process.

The Current Method
------------------

The existing method involves several manual steps:

1. **Meet Creation:**
   - The meet organizer creates the meet using the Meet Manager platform.
   - A .lxf file, containing crucial meet information (such as name, location, organizers, and structure), is generated.

2. **File Distribution:**
   - The .lxf file is sent by the organizer to both Swim Ranking (an external database storing swim meet information) and the participating club via email.

3. **Club Data Entry:**
   - The club, using the Team Manager platform, populates the .lxf file with athlete information.
   - The club then sends the filled file back to the meet organizer via email.

4. **Individual Validation:**
   - The meet organizer, utilizing the FPN System, individually validates whether each athlete is affiliated with the FPN and has valid medical exams until the meet's final date.

5. **Payment and Confirmation:**
   - The club processes payments for each participating athlete and sends the payment proof to the meet organizer via email.

6. **Results Submission:**
   - At the end of the meet, the organizer sends the meet results to Swim Rankings.

Our Solution
------------

EasySwim proposes a more efficient process:

1. **Parallel Platform:**
   - After creating the .lxf file in Meet Manager, the meet organizer sends it to our EasySwim platform.

2. **Club Data Entry:**
   - The participating club retrieves the .lxf file from our platform.
   - The club populates the file with athlete information using the Team Manager platform.

3. **Automated Validation:**
   - Our platform, integrated with the FPN System, automatically checks whether athletes are affiliated with the federation and have valid medical exams until the meet's end.

4. **Payment Request:**
   - The platform generates a new .lxf file containing information on valid athletes and requests payment from the club.

5. **Confirmation of Payments:**
   - After the club completes the payment, our platform sends the updated .lxf file to the meet organizer, indicating that the registrations are paid.

This streamlined approach significantly reduces manual efforts and enhances the overall efficiency of managing swim meets.
