Components
----------
The EasySwim platform adopts this approach to managing swim-related data, integrating a React frontend, Django backend, and Axios for seamless communication. Let's delve into the details of each component:

Frontend - React (Container)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The frontend of EasySwim is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a modular and component-based structure, enabling a scalable and maintainable frontend architecture. The frontend is containerized using Docker, a platform that facilitates the development, deployment, and execution of applications in a consistent manner.

Backend - Django (Container)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend of EasySwim is powered by Django, a Python web framework known for its simplicity and flexibility. Django facilitates the development of robust backend systems with features like an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions, authentication mechanisms, and RESTful API development. The backend is containerized using Docker, a platform that facilitates the development, deployment, and execution of applications in a consistent manner.


Axios - Seamless Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Axios is employed as the HTTP client to establish seamless communication between the React frontend and Django backend. Axios simplifies the handling of HTTP requests and responses, ensuring efficient data exchange between the client and server components.

Deployment on Digital Ocean Apps
---------------------------------

EasySwim is deployed on Digital Ocean Apps, a platform that provides a streamlined and scalable hosting solution. Digital Ocean apps with GitHub integration, enabling automatic deployments upon code changes.

By combining the power of React, Django, Axios, and Digital Ocean Apps, EasySwim delivers a user-friendly interface, efficient data processing, and a robust infrastructure to meet the demands of managing swim-related information effectively.
